Train Notebook
Overview
Welcome to the Train Notebook! This Jupyter notebook is designed for analyzing and modeling data related to GPS fixes, loan outcomes, and user attributes. It provides a comprehensive framework for data exploration, visualization, and machine learning.
Features
Data Import: Easily load datasets from CSV files, including GPS fixes, loan outcomes, and user attributes.
Data Analysis: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the underlying patterns in the data.
Visualization: Utilize Matplotlib for creating insightful visualizations that help in understanding data distributions and relationships.
Model Training: Implement machine learning models to predict loan outcomes based on user attributes and GPS data.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following installed:
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Required libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib
Installation
You can install the necessary libraries using pip:
bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
Running the Notebook
Clone or download this repository.
Navigate to the directory containing Train_notebook.ipynb.
Launch Jupyter Notebook:
bash
jupyter notebook
Open Train_notebook.ipynb and execute the cells sequentially.
Data Description
The notebook utilizes three main datasets:
GPS Fixes: Contains location data with timestamps, accuracy, and user IDs.
Loan Outcomes: Includes information about loan applications and their outcomes (e.g., defaulted or repaid).
User Attributes: Comprises demographic details such as age and income over the last 30 days.
Example Analysis
The notebook includes code snippets for:
Loading datasets:
python
gps = pd.read_csv('gps_fixes.csv')
loan = pd.read_csv('loan_outcomes.csv')
user = pd.read_csv('user_attributes.csv')
Visualizing data distributions:
python
plt.hist(user['age'], bins=20)
plt.title('Age Distribution of Users')
plt.xlabel('Age')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()
